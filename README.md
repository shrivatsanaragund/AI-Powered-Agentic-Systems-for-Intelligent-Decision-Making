# AI-Powered-Agentic-Systems-for-Intelligent-Decision-Making

This project demonstrates the power of AI Agents integrated with multiple data sources and AI models, including Groq, Gemini, OpenAI, and more. The agents interact with different tools and APIs to perform various tasks such as web search, financial analysis, PDF-based assistance, and video summarization.

## Usage

### Web Search Agent
This agent is designed to search the web for information based on user queries. Once the agent is running, you can interact with it through the command line interface (CLI) or via the user interface if applicable.

### Financial Agent
This agent retrieves financial data, including stock prices, analyst recommendations, and company news. You can input the stock symbol or company name to get insights into the latest financial trends.

### PDF Assistant
The PDF assistant lets you interact with a knowledge base built from PDF documents. Upload a PDF, and the assistant can answer your questions by searching the document.

### Video Summarizer
Upload a video and ask questions related to its content. The agent will process the video and provide insightful answers. This is powered by Google Gemini and utilizes video analysis and web research for enhanced responses.

## Example Queries

### Web Search Agent
- "What's the latest news on Tesla?"
- "Find articles about climate change."

### Financial Agent
- "Get stock prices for NVDA."
- "What are the latest analyst recommendations for Apple?"

### Video Summarizer
- "Summarize the key points of this video."
- "What is discussed about AI in this video?"

### PDF Assistant
- "Search for the recipe for Pad Thai in this document."
- "What ingredients are listed for the Thai soup?"
